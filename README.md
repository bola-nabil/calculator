# 🧮 C++ Calculator Project

---
## 📖 Description
This is a simple **console-based calculator** implemented in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The project demonstrates **abstract classes, inheritance, virtual functions, exception handling, and mathematical operations**.

The calculator supports common arithmetic operations as well as advanced ones like power and square root.

## 📸 Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)
- Power (xⁿ)
- Square root
- Menu-driven interface
- Option to continue calculations until the user chooses to exit

---
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C++** (OOP concepts: abstract class, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling)
- **Standard Library (cmath, iostream)**
